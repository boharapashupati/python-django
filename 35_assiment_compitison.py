1.#prints whether the number is even or odd.

# Number = int(input("enter your number: "))
# remainder = Number%2
# if remainder ==0:
#     print("this number is odd! ")
# else:

2.# write a progam that finds the highest and loowest digit in a give string of numbers.
# Number = input("enter a string of numbers: ")
# highest_num = (Number)
# lowest_num =(Number)
# print()

3.#write a program that takes a sentance as input and count the number of words in it.
#exm input :"python is fun"
#exm output :number of words = 3

# sentence = input("enter your word: ")
# words = sentence.split()
# word_count =len(words)
# print("the number of words in the sentance is:", word_count )

4.#write a python program that takes a positive integer as input and calculates the sum of its digits.
# i= int(input("enter a positive number: "))
# sum = 0
# while (i>0):
#         sum= sum+i%10
#         i=i //10
#         print("sum of digits: ", sum)


5.#write a program that takes a string as input and prints the string in reverse order.

# input_number = input("enter a string: ")
# reverse_string = input_number[::-1]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
# print(reverse_string)


6.#Write a program that checks if a givenword is a palindrome (reads the sameforwards and backwards)
 
# a = input("enter the your word: ")
# b= a[::-1]
# if(a==b):
#     print("yes,it is palindrome")
# else:
#     print("no,it is not palindrome")
    
    
7. # Write a program that calculates the factorial of a given number n (where n is provided by the user).
   
# n = int(input("Enter a number to find factorial: "))
# factorial = 1
# for i in range(1, n+1):
#    factorial*=i
#    print(f"the factorial of {n} is {factorial}")
   
8. #  Write a program that counts the numberof vowels (a, e, i, o, u) in a given string.
